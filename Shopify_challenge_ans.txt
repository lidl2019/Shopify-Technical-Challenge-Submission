Question 1:

This dataset is miscalculated by sum up the "order_amount" column and divided by 5000. 
However 5000 is not the right amount since there are orders with multiple items. 
The correct calculation involves both the "order_amount" and the "total_items" columns, and the correct answer should be 357.92


Question 2:

(a):
SELECT *, Count(*) FROM Orders Left Join Shippers on Orders.ShipperID = Shippers.ShipperID where Shippers.ShipperName = "Speedy Express"  

(result = 54)

(b):
SELECT Employees.LastName, Count(Orders.EmployeeID) FROM Orders Left Join Employees on
Orders.EmployeeID=Employees.EmployeeID Group by Orders.EmployeeID order by Count(Orders.EmployeeID) Desc 

(result = 40, name = Peacock)

(c):
SELECT ProductName, Sum(Quantity) FROM OrderDetails Left Join Products on OrderDetails.ProductID = Products.ProductID 
group by OrderDetails.ProductID order by Sum(Quantity) desc 

(Gorgonzola Telino, 458 orders)
